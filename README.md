# reCAPTCHA on Ionic
Most online implementations of reCAPTCHA for android and iOS leverages the webview, using the reCAPTCHA for web. There are a few problems a developer will quickly encounter with that approach, mostly related to iOS security.
After dealing with a bunch of problems on iOS, trying to integrate reCAPTCHA on ionic's webview, I simply decided to take a native approach.
This is still under development and once I feel it's ready to use, I will update this read me with instructions.
